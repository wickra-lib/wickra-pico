# Security Policy

`wickra-pico` is a computation library: it folds prices and candles through
streaming indicators on bare metal. It holds no secret material, opens no network
connection, and reads no filesystem in its core path. The attack surface is
therefore narrow — principally the arithmetic on untrusted numeric input as it
crosses the no-alloc C ABI. See [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md) for the asset
inventory and trust boundaries.

## Supported versions

Security fixes land on `main` and ship in the next release. `0.1.1` is the
first published release; no earlier version exists to support.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.1 (latest) | ✅ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for security
problems.** Report privately through either channel:

- GitHub → the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**
  (private advisory), or
- email **support@wickra.org**.

Include a description, affected version/commit, target, reproduction steps and
impact.

We aim to acknowledge within a few days, agree a disclosure timeline, and credit
reporters who wish to be named once a fix ships.

## Scope

In scope: memory-safety or panic-across-FFI flaws in the no-alloc C ABI and its
handle protocol, and any input that makes the core panic (a panic on an MCU is a
reset/halt) or produce a value that diverges from the `wickra-core` reference.
Out of scope: incorrect indicator mathematics that is nonetheless deterministic
and matches `wickra-core` (a shared functional question, not a vulnerability),
and advisories in third-party crates already tracked and triaged.

## Vulnerability disclosure (VEX)

This repository ships a machine-readable VEX record in
[`osv-scanner.toml`](osv-scanner.toml), kept in lock-step with the cargo-deny
advisory ignore list in [`deny.toml`](deny.toml). Any advisory assessed as not
affecting `wickra-pico` is documented there with a reason.
