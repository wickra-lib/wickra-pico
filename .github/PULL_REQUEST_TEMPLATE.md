     Changing the release process, the bindings' shared surface, or the public

     GitHub offers no picker for a second template, so it is only reachable that

## Checklist

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` are clean

- [ ] `cargo test -p wickra-pico-signal --all-features` passes, including the byte-parity tests against `wickra-core`
- [ ] `cargo deny check` is clean
- [ ] Determinism preserved (fixed f64 operation order; no alloc, HashMap, time or RNG in the core path)
- [ ] Any new indicator ships a parity test against `wickra-core`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `[Unreleased]`
